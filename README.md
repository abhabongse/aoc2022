Attempts to solve problems at [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) mostly using Python 3.11

## How to Run Scripts

The easiest way to set up a run-time environment in the local machine is to

1. Ensure that you have the most updated version of `pip>=22.0.0`
2. Create a new virtual environment with any method you like
3. Simply execute `pip install .` from the project

It will take sometime as this script will download Poetry
and use it to build a package that will be immediately installed along with its dependencies.

If you are looking for a more robust development setup
with editable installation, [check here](DEVELOP.md).
